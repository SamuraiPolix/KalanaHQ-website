# KalanaHQ-website

This is a website I developed for kalanaâ„¢ in 2021.

I used [three-globe](https://github.com/vasturiano/three-globe) (a [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) WebGL class to represent data visualization layers on a globe, using a spherical projection) for the home page.

I need to make it load faster.

NOTE:
This is no longer their website, I published it to show the work I did because they changed it. Kalana owns the copyrights for this project, licensed under the MIT license.
