                    <p class="mb-4">The GDPR is a new comprehensive data protection law (in effect May 25, 2018) in
                        the EU that regulates the processing of personal data and expands the privacy rights
                        of EU individuals. Kalana complies with the principles promulgated by the GDPR. For
                        more information about GDPR please visit the GDPR portal at <a href="https://www.eugdpr.org/"

                    <p>Kalana commits to cooperating with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) and
                        comply with the advice given by such authorities with regard to human resources
                        data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship.</p>

                    PERSONAL DATA?</h2>
                <p class="mb-4">We are committed to safeguarding your information. We employ administrative,
                    physical, and electronic measures designed to protect your information from
                    unauthorized access. We implement appropriate technical and organizational
                    measures to ensure a level of security appropriate for the risk, taking into account
                    technological reality, cost, the scope, context and purposes of processing weighted
                    against the severity and likelihood that the processing could threaten individual
                    rights and freedoms. For example, we use commercially reasonable security
                    measures such as encryption, firewalls, and transport layer security (TLS) or
                    hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) to protect personal data.</p>
                <p class="mb-4">Please note that no security system is impenetrable. Accordingly, we do not
                    guarantee the security of our databases, nor that information you supply will not be
                    intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet or other network. You
                    transmit any information to us at your own risk. We are not responsible for
                    circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on or within
                    our services.</p>
                <p>We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security,
                    confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to
                    you via email or conspicuous posting through this website in the most expedient
                    time possible and without unreasonable delay, as consistent with the legitimate
                    needs of law enforcement or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the
                    breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.</p>

                <p>Some Web browsers may be configured to send Do Not Track signals to websites, or
                    users may use similar mechanisms, to indicate a user’s preference that certain web

                <p class="mb-4">We are in compliance with the requirements of Children’s Online <strong>Privacy
                        Protection Act (COPPA)</strong> and do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of
                    age. Our website and services are all intended for individuals who are at least 13 years old
                    or older. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on or through this
                    website. If we learn that we have collected or received personal data from a child
                    under 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information. If you are a parent
                    or guardian or otherwise believe we might have any information from or about a child
                    under 13, please contact us so that we can delete the child’s information. We will
                    never knowingly accept, collect, maintain or use any information from a child under
                    the age of 13. If a child whom we know to be under the age of 13 sends personal
                    data to us online, we will only use that information to respond directly to that child or
                    notify parents.</p>

                    do not receive timely acknowledgement of your complaint, or if your complaint is not
                    satisfactorily addressed, you can also submit your complaint to Privacy Trust, an
